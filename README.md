Why is this analysis important?

An analyst can help prospective buyers to understand in cost estimation. Overpriced or Underpriced(Mega Deals!!) Houses can be spotted 


Results:

1) The Lasso model from sklearn provided the best accuracy among models
2) About 91%(Accuracy of Model)of change in the Sales Price could be accounted for by the variables in my model. 
3) The most correlated columns to sales price were quality & Living area
